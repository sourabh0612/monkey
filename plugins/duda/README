Duda: Web Services Framework
============================
Duda is a web services framework for Monkey HTTP Daemon, it 
expose a new and clean api for event-driven web services.

For more details about how Duda works please check the spec.txt 
file located under the docs/ directory.

Setup
=====
- Enable the duda plugin in conf/plugins.load.

- Edit conf/plugins/duda/duda.conf configuration file and set the key 
ServicesRoot with the absolute path where the services files are 
located, e.g:

  [DUDA]
      ServicesRoot /home/foo/monkey/services

- Edit the virtual host configuration file where the service will work, 
as an example edit conf/sites/default and add the following 
entry:

  [WEB_SERVICE]
      Name     hello
      Enabled  on

we have instructed to load service "hello", so Duda will try to locate 
the service file 'hello.duda' under ServicesRoot directory and load it.
